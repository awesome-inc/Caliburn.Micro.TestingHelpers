This package includes a simple build.bat and MSBuild targets bringing you closer to
the famous 1-Click-Build. The build.bat shortcuts to MSBuild, the targets include 
versioning (with GitVersion), running tests (with NUnit) and computing code coverage (with OpenCover).
The package aims to reduce dependencies on pre-installed external tools by getting
the runners directly from NuGet. The only thing you need is 
  1) .NET for MSBuild (preinstalled since Windows 7) and
  2) NuGet (preinstalled with activating NuGet Package Restore)
A new member coming to your team does not require anything to compile, run test, etc.
This makes it also perfectly suitable for continuous integration since your build jobs
reduce to the same one-liner you can use in development.
